## GeoDataViz Toolkit â€“ Workshops

A workshop is a meeting at which a group of people engage in discussion and activity on a particular topic. We often host workshops at different events and we want to use the GeoDataViz Toolkit to share them more broadly. The topics usually focus on a particular aspect of cartography or data visualisation.

_This repository contains technical workshop material that you can download, follow, share and re-use._

## Using the workshops

**Download and use** - Each workshop has its own folder in which you will find a workbook and data. 

**Share and re-use** - All the data used will be open. We try and focus the content around theory and practical application - we inevitably need to use software so we choose tools that are free or open (accessible to all).

## Feedback

If you have any feedback about these workshops then please raise an issue on this repository.

Thank you
