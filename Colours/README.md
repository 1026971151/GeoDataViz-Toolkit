## GeoDataViz Toolkit - Colour

The use of colour is very often fundamental to the success of a data visualisation. Colour can help with many elements of your design from improving visual contrast to simply catching the eye. Careful use of colour enhances clarity, aids storytelling and draws a viewer into your dataset. Poor use of colour can obscure data, or even mislead.

## GeoDataViz Colour Palettes

These colour palettes have been selected to offer a good range of options depending on your data. We have carefully considered [colour vision deficiencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness) and each colour scheme has been tested for compatibility.

_You can view and download the colour palette PDF from this repository._

## Using these colour palettes:

Which colours you use will be determined by what type of data you are visualising. Here is a guide to choosing the right palette:

_Qualitative -_ Use these colour schemes to represent different categories of data. For example, a qualitative scheme is a good choice for showing different types of Points of Interest.

_Red, Amber, Green -_ Use these colours to represent a RAG status or [traffic light rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light_rating_system). For example, you may use these colours to represent the operational status of lamp posts.

_Sequential -_ These colour schemes are ideal for data that follows an order, often numeric ranging from low to high. We have single hue and multi-hue options but they are all ordered by a difference in lightness/saturation. For example, you may use a sequential colour scheme to show counts within a hexagonal grid.

_Diverging_ â€“ Use these colour schemes to highlight values that are above and below an interesting mid-point in quantitative data. Two sequential colour ramps emanate from the neutral colour in the middle which often represents zero or an average value. This is a great way to show data values that differ greatly from the norm. For example, you may use a diverging colour scheme to show population change.
