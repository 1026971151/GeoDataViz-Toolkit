## GeoDataViz Toolkit - Basemaps

Often referred to as a contextual or backdrop map, a basemap contains reference information used to both orient the map and add context to any data that is overlaid.

## The OS range of basemap styles:

We have created four house styles for our basemaps:

**Road:** A familiar style with a focus on transport networks - specifically highlighting the Great British road network. High in contrast with lots of detail and colour, this style will fit many uses and satisfy those who are familiar with traditional OS maps.

**Outdoor:** Designed for outdoor leisure and used within our OS Maps desktop and mobile application. Borrowing certain design elements from our traditional paper maps this style focusses on terrain and land cover, has a minimal colour palette and contains familiar symbology.

**Light:** Designed specifically for data visualisation, this style has a subtle palette and is simple and clear. Use it to add geographic context and make your own data shine.

**Night:** Night mode mapping that&#39;s great in dark environments. It&#39;s at its best on a mobile device, and the dark pixels can help save your battery. See your own data really pop using this style.

## Selecting the right basemap style:

If you are not intending to add any data overlays then use the **Road** style. If your application is Leisure focused or if the road network is of particular importance then you should use **Outdoor**. If you want to overlay additional layers of data and you are looking for a basemap to simply add context then you should use **Light** or **Night** â€“ the decision as to which is purely an aesthetic one however, using a dark basemap can be arguably more &#39;eye-catching&#39;, yet Light can be more &#39;practical&#39;.

## OS Maps API

All of these basemaps are available through the [OS Maps API](https://developer.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/os-maps-api-enterprise).
