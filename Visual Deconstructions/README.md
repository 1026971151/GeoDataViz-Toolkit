## GeoDataViz Toolkit â€“ visual deconstructions

_Taking visualisations apart to understand how they were made._

A visual deconstruction is a method of recording the styling rules for a data visualisation. It is made up of a title, a description, a url where relevant, keyword tags, an image, plus the draw order and styling information for each layer of data from which it is compiled.

It is a form of documentation that allows you to quickly reference and recreate styling rules, as well as being able to share it clearly with others. It is also a great way to learn how something is made and therefore is a useful tool for someone designing their own visualisation.

_This repository contains all of our visual deconstructions which can be viewed in the browser or downloaded and even printed._

## Using visual deconstructions:

**Copy the colours** - We list all the styling information including hex colour codes so you can grab the colours and apply them to your own work.

**View in the browser** - You can view the PDFs directly in the browser by selecting one within this repository.

**Download and print** - Print them as a reference when you&#39;re designing your own visualisations. Our visual deconstructions are 210mm wide so they are printable on A4.

## Make your own visual deconstructions:

In this repository you will find templates from which you can create your own visual deconstructions. We have made them available in Adobe Illustrator (AI) files, compatible with CS6 and CC.

_If you do make your own then please let us know via Twitter: @cartocraftsman and @charley\_glynn_
